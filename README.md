# Asphalt 9 Website Redesign

This project is a redesigned, unofficial replica of the Asphalt 9: Legends website, created as a course project for Human and Computer Interaction. It is a fully responsive frontend application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
*   **Multi-Page Layout:** The website is structured into several distinct pages:
    *   **Home:** A landing page featuring an introduction, game overview, and key feature highlights.
    *   **Gallery:** An interactive car gallery with a custom-built JavaScript carousel to browse vehicles by tier (S, A, B, C, D).
    *   **News:** Displays the latest game news and updates with a "Load More" button to dynamically show more articles.
    *   **Event:** Showcases e-sport event statistics, achievements, and official partners.
    *   **Subscription:** A subscription form with client-side validation to ensure data integrity before submission.
*   **Dynamic Interactivity:** JavaScript is used to power the mobile navigation menu, the car gallery carousel, the "Load More" news functionality, and the subscription form validation.
*   **Pure Frontend:** Built entirely with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) without any backend or frameworks.
